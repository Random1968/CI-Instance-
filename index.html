        <h2>Continious Integration Definition</h2>
        
        <p>
            <b>Continuous integration (CI)</b> is a software development practice of regularly integrating your code changes into a shared code repository. Typically, this would happen at least once or even several times a day (depending on the number of code commits) and this practice encourages committing small changes more often over committing large changes infrequently. Each commit triggers a build during which tests are run that help to identify if anything was broken by the changes.</p>
